# Introduction to the Script
This script opens an exisiting email account once the username and the password are given and read N number of email from folder "MAST." You can enter how many emails you want to read (into variable N) from the main function in masteval.py. The location of the file must be passed in the main function also.   
# Specific files used in this Script
In this code, my input file is "Progress Check-Ins 2020.xlsx". You can change this file into any other XLSX if desired. My output file is "news.xlsx". You can also save the result on your input file. Just remember that while running these codes, the output file can not be running on your computer. 
While searching for name on the file, I specify which column I search. The specific column can be changed according to different file design. It is also possible to check for the entire file
